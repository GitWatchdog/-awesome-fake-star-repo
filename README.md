Hey... welcome to Awesome Fake Star Repo!

This is a fun and slightly serious project where we collect and look closely at GitHub repos that seem... suspiciously popular.

Here, we document and explore the world of artificial hype in open source. It’s part research, part curiosity, and part calling out the nonsense.

🎯 What’s the point?
To remind folks that real credibility comes from real contributions, not inflated numbers.

🧠 What we’re working on
We’re building a detection tool to help spot unusual star patterns. It’s still early days, but the goal is to make it easier to tell when something's fishy.

🛠️ Want to help?
Awesome! If you’ve come across a repo that skyrocketed in popularity out of nowhere, open an issue or drop a pull request. You can also help us make the detection smarter.

Let’s keep open source honest, or at least a little less fake.
