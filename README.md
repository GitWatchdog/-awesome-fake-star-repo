# awesome-fake-star-repo
Welcome to awesome-fake-star-repo!

A curated collection of projects that have mastered the art of appearing popular through the fine craft of fake GitHub stars.

Here we document, analyze, and celebrate the hidden world of artificial open-source "success."

🎯 Our mission?
To highlight how real credibility is built, not bought.

🧠 What's Next:
We are actively developing a smart detection algorithm to identify suspicious star activity automatically. 🚀

🛠️ Contributions Welcome!

📈 If you know a repo that climbed the fame ladder a little too fast (or suspiciously), feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
 Or help us refine the detection methods.

📈 Let's work together to make open source more transparent and trustworthy.
