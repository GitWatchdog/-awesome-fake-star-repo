# awesome-fake-star-repo
Welcome to awesome-fake-star-repo!

A curated collection of projects that have mastered the art of appearing popular through the fine craft of fake GitHub stars.

Here we document, analyze, and celebrate the hidden world of artificial open-source "success."

ðŸ“ˆ If you know a repo that climbed the fame ladder a little too fast (or suspiciously), feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.

ðŸŽ¯ Our mission? To highlight how real credibility is built, not bought.
